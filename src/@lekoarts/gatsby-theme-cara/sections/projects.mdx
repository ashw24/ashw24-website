  Using a text file consisting of movie names and actors, I was able to determine a path from one actor to another based on the movies they and their costars have acted in. Utilizing Graphs and a Breadth First Search algorithm, I was able to find the shortest number of connections required to connect these actors. This project was based on the pop-culture game Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon(Bacon's Law).

  Utilizing the stack data structure, I was able to simulate recursion with backtracking and solve the n-queens problem. The n-queens problem takes a chessboard of size n and existing queens and utilizes that information to determine where n queens can be placed without attacking one another.

  Developed a machine learning algorithm that utilized the Glucose SAT solver and Python in order to solve boolean expressions in Sudoku
format by parsing through multi-dimensional arrays.
